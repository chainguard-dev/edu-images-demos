# C/C++ Demo

This repository contains three examples showing single and multi-stage builds for C-based programs using Chainguard Images. For a complete tutorial, please refer to the Chainguard Academy [Getting Started with the C/C++ Chainguard Images guide](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/getting-started/c/).

# Running the Demo

To run this demo on your machine, you will need to have both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed locally.

Clone this repository locally and navigate to the `c` directory in your terminal. Here, you can test the `hello.c` program by compiling it with `gcc`.

```sh
gcc -Wall -o hello hello.c
```

You can execute the resultant binary with the following command:

```sh
./hello
```

You will see the following output in your terminal.

```Output
Hello, world!
I am a demo from the Chainguard Academy.
My code was written in C.
```

Now, with Docker Engine running, you can compile this program inside of the `gcc-glibc` Chainguard Image. You will use `Dockerfile1` for this image build.

`Dockerfile1` will:
1. Use the `gcc-glibc:latest` Chainguard Image as the base image;
2. Create and set the current working directory to `/home/build`;
3. Copy the `hello.c` program code to the current directory;
4. Compile the program and name it `hello`;
5. Copy the compiled binary to `/usr/bin`;
6. Set the image to run as a non-root user; and,
7. Execute the compiled binary when the container is started.

Execute the following command to initiate the image build.
```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile1 -t example1:latest .
```

Once your image build it complete, run the following command to start a container.
```sh
docker run --name example1 example1:latest
```

You will see output in your terminal identical to that of the binary you compiled locally.
